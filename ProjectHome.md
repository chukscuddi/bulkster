Bulkster is a tool that will send bulk email out to a list.  It's designed to be simple and straightforward to use and has been created with sendmail and postfix in mind.  Bulkster will take your list of email addresses, merge that with a note, the product will be many message files (one to each email address, such that you can personalize a few) and a batch file that feeds them to your mail server.  Speed can be controlled, and you can embed substitution tags in the text of the note.

Bulkster is written in the REXX, and could easily be ported to Perl and other excellent scripting languages.  The vision is to expand Bulkster to be the best bulk email / marketing tool available.

Hell, someone's got to do it... :)
